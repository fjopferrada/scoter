# Introduction

Scoter produces age models for geological records by aligning parameters
measured from those records with dated reference curves. While Scoter is
mainly intended for correlation of δ^18^O and relative palaeointensity (RPI)
records, it can in practice be used on any numerical parameter.

Scoter can use two techniques for alignment: its own simulated annealing
algorithm, and the Match program of @lisiecki2002application. If the Match
program is to be used, it must be installed separately.

# Installation

Scoter is written in Python (version 2.7) and can run on any operating system
with the requisite Python libraries installed.

## The data tabs

These tabs allow you to read data files, plot the data, and select which
parts of the record and target data should be correlated. The tabs are 
labelled ‘δ^18^O’ and ‘RPI’, but in fact any measured downcore parameter
can be used. The only special treatment provided for δ^18^O data is that,
in accordance with convention, the y-axis is inverted in the plots.

For each record or target data-set, two buttons are provided: ‘Read’ and
‘Clear’. ‘Read’ lets you choose a file for Scoter to read; ‘Clear’ clears 
any data which has been read for that data-set.

# Non-interactive operation

Graphic, interactive applications for data analysis have obvious advantages
over non-interactive programs: they allow easy visualization of results and
quick, easy experimentation with parameters. They also have disadvantages:
analyses can be hard to automate or to reproduce exactly. Scoter allows both
approaches, and can be run either as a graphical desktop application or as a
non-interactive command-line application. The parameters for a correlation
can be explored interactively in the graphical interface, then saved as a
configuration file. This configuration file can be used to automatically
re-run the configuration with the same parameters, ensuring the
reproducibility of the analysis.

## Configuration file

## Command-line operation

## Usage as a Python module

As well as a command-line interface, Scoter provides an
application-programmer interface (API) allowing it to be integrated into
other programs.
