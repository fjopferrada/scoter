# Introduction

Scoter produces age models for geological records by aligning parameters
measured from those records with dated reference curves. While Scoter is
mainly intended for correlation of δ^18^O and relative palaeointensity (RPI)
records, it can in practice be used on any numerical parameter.

Scoter can use two techniques for alignment: its own simulated annealing
algorithm, and the Match program of @lisiecki2002application. If the Match
program is to be used, it must be installed separately.

# Installation

Scoter is written in Python (version 2.7) and can run on any operating system
with the requisite Python libraries installed.

## Windows

## Mac OS X

## Linux

## Installing Match

Scoter uses its own simulated annealing algorithm to correlate records, but
optionally it can also make use of the Match program of
@lisiecki2002application. Match is not distributed as part of Scoter, and
must be installed separately before Scoter can make use of it. Downloads and
installation instructions for Match are available at
<http://lorraine-lisiecki.com/match.html>. Once Match has been installed, its
functions can be controlled through the
[correlation tab](#the-correlation-tab).

# The main Scoter window

![The main Scoter window](placeholder.png)

Most of Scoter's operations are controlled through a single main window,
divided into a number of tabs. In general, a typical correlation workgflow
involves working through the tabs from left to right.

## The data tabs

These tabs allow you to read data files, plot the data, and select which
parts of the record and target data should be correlated. The tabs are 
labelled ‘δ^18^O’ and ‘RPI’, but in fact any measured downcore parameter
can be used. The only special treatment provided for δ^18^O data is that,
in accordance with common practice, the y-axis is inverted in the plots.

For each record or target data-set, two buttons are provided: ‘Read’ and
‘Clear’. ‘Read’ lets you choose a file for Scoter to read; ‘Clear’ clears 
any data which has been read for that data-set.

The correlation need to be performed on the complete data series: each series
can be clipped, so that only a selected portion of the data is considered.
The selection is controlled by clicking on the data graphs, as follows:

Left click
:   Set left-hand limit (i.e. shallowest or youngest)
Right click
:   Set right-hand limit (i.e. deepest or oldest)
Middle click
:   Cancel existing limits and revert to using whole data series

When clipping limits have been set for a series, the selected portion is
highlighted in yellow.

## The preprocessing tab

This tab controls the preprocessing steps that are applied to the 
data before the actual correlation takes place.

## The correlation tab

This tab controls the settings for the actual correlation procedures,
using either Scoter's built-in simulated annealing algorithm or the
Match program of @lisiecki2002application. (Remember that, in order to 
be used, the Match program must be installed separately.)

Press the ‘Correlate’ button at the bottom right of this tab to start the
actual correlation.

## The progress tab

This tab is only active during the actual correlation procedure. Depending on
the speed of the computer, the number of data points, and the chosen
configuration options, correlation can be nearly instantaneous or can take
several minutes. The progress bar at the top shows how far the simulated
annealing has proceeded. Pressing ‘Abort’ button at the bottom right will
stop the simulated annealing process and abort the correlation attempt.

## The results tabs

These two tabs show the results of the correlations performed using
simulated annealing and the Match program.

# Advanced operation: using Scoter without the graphical interface

Graphic, interactive applications for data analysis have obvious advantages
over non-interactive programs: they allow easy visualization of results and
quick, easy experimentation with parameters. They also have disadvantages:
analyses can be hard to automate or to reproduce exactly. Scoter allows both
approaches, and can be run either as a graphical desktop application or as a
non-interactive command-line application. The parameters for a correlation
can be explored interactively in the graphical interface, then saved as a
configuration file. This configuration file can be used to automatically
re-run the configuration with the same parameters, ensuring the
reproducibility of the analysis.

## Configuration file

Non-interactive Scoter does not use the same format of configuration file as
the graphical interface, but from the graphical interface you can export a
configuration for the non-interactive version. This allows you to explore
analysis parameters using the graphical interface, while providing a way to
re-run the exact same analysis with no human intervention. A configuration
file for non-interactive analysis can also be written or edited directly
by hand, since it uses a simple text-based format. The easiest way to
create a configuration file by hand is to make a copy of the supplied 
template file and edit it to your needs.

## Command-line operation

In normal operation, running Scoter from the command line is straightforward:

    scoter.py CONFIG

-- where CONFIG is the name of the configuration file. A few options are
available:

`-h, --help`
:   Show a help message and exit.
`--write-config FILENAME`
:   Write a configuration template to the supplied filename. The template
	can then be edited by hand to produce a working configuration file.
`--overwrite`
:   When writing a configuration template, overwrite any existing
	file of the same name.
`--log-level level`
:   Set the logging level. This option is intended for development and
	debugging of the Scoter program itself, and is unlikely to be useful to
	most users.

## Usage as a Python module

As well as a command-line interface, Scoter provides an
application-programmer interface (API) allowing it to be integrated into
other programs.
