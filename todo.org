* Tasks
** DONE 001 Look at namedtuple for configuration parameters
   CLOSED: [2013-11-17 Sun 10:25]
** DONE 002 Fix the multiply-inverting y-axes
   CLOSED: [2013-11-08 Fri 21:55]
** TODO 003 Better handling for non-equal-length series
   Currently bombs out with an error. Should catch the error
   and present it to the user via the GUI.
** TODO 004 Tidy up live SA plot code a bit
** TODO 005 Idea for improving the SA scheduler
   In the adaptive scheduler, a temperature step can be terminated either (2)
   by clocking a certain number of accepted changes or (as a fallback when
   improvements are impossible) (2) by going through a certain number of
   iterations. The termination condition is actually valuable information! If
   (2) occurs, there's an implication that we're in a local minimum --
   perhaps this means we can increase the cooling rate. Vice versa may also
   apply, but need to think about it carefully: what if it's just a
   metastable state where we're continually hopping between the same few
   solutions?

   Need more of these ‘self-steering’ adaptations so users don't need
   to manually tweak a bunch of incomprehensible simulated annealing
   parameters for each new dataset.
** DONE 006 Store user preferences using wx.Config API
   CLOSED: [2013-11-17 Sun 10:24]
** TODO 007 Add an interface to the Match program
** DONE 008 Add SA configuration options to correlation pane
   CLOSED: [2013-11-22 Fri 09:56]
** DONE 009 Add SA parameters to Scoter arguments
   CLOSED: [2013-11-22 Fri 09:56]
   Random seed, start/end temperatures, cooling rate, thresholds, rate
   change penalty, ... hopefully at least some of these will become
   irrelevant or automatically configurable in time, but for now they should
   at least not be baked into the code.
** DONE 010 ScoterGui.quit() not called on window closing
   CLOSED: [2013-11-17 Sun 10:36]
   The application quits when the window closes, but quit() is
   only called if the application is terminated via the Quit menu
   item. So any required housekeeping in quit() is not guaranteed
   to be called. At the moment, said housekeeping consists of saving
   the current parameters via the wx.Config API.

** TODO 011 Add settings import/export feature
   The user should be able to save the entire state of the Scoter
   ‘workspace’ (including data sources, preprocessing, and
   correlation configuration) to a file and reload it to restore
   the state.
** TODO 012 Add ‘reset configuration’ button
   An essential complement to a configuration that persists across
   restarts of the program!
** TODO 013 Make progress bar work correctly
   Currently the progress bar only shows realistic progress if the
   final temperature is 1.

** TODO 014 Add a plot-based GUI to truncate series
   The current design, with truncation text entry boxes in the
   preprocessing tab, is a little clunky: it would be better to
   have the truncation options in the data-series tabs with
   the graphs, with a hook into matplotlib to allow the user to
   select the truncation points graphically.
